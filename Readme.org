* AoCCommon

Common utility code for Advent of Code solutions in Swift.

Note: This is a work in progress and not-fully documented. Many things are liable to change and to break.

** Installation
To use the `AoCCommon` library in a SwiftPM project, add the following line to the dependencies in your `Package.swift` file:

#+begin_src swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/Abizern/AoCCommon", "0.1.0" ..< "0.2.0"),
#+end_src

This will define a dependency up to the next minor version.

Include ="AoCCommon"= as a dependency for your target:

#+begin_src swift
.target(name: "<target>", dependencies: [
    .product(name: "AoCCommon", package: "AoCCommon"),
]),
#+end_src

** ToDo

As mentioned, documentation is limited and I really should try improve them.
